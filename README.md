# QW2PA
Code to simulate two-photon absorption in quantum wells to fit to experimental data

The general use of this software goes as follows:

1. Run analyze_scans.m in the Main directory for selected data files from the QW Data directory
2. Copy the resulting 2PA coefficient fits into the Final Pump Probe Fits directory
3. Run compare_simulations_and_data.m to simulate the 2PA coefficients and plot against the measured results
